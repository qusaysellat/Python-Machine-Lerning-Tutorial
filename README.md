# Python Frameworks for Machine Learning
This is a simple in-progress tutorial on various python machine learning frameworks.
## TensorFlow
[TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) is an "open source machine learning framework for everyone". This tutorial contains many examples about known Deep Learning models. All examples were implemented in Google Colab environment using version 1.14.0 of TensorFlow. 
## Keras
[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) is a "Deep Learning for humans" framework. It is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. This tutorial contains many examples about known Deep Learning models. All examples were implemented in Google Colab environment using version 2.2.5 of Keras.
